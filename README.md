# SEDC_Selenium_POM_Homework

The following homework will include creating new project and importing all dependencies. The project name will be Selenium-Homework-FirstName and Last Name. 

We will need to create 3 tests using the POM (Page Object Model) as follows:

1. On the following link: https://demoqa.com/links under category Following links will send an api calls click all links and assert all messages that they display for each link.

2. On the following link: https://demoqa.com/login we will need a data provider with 5 arrays (meaning populate the fields username and password with different values) to insert username, password, click login and verify the message Invalid Username or Password.

3. On the same link we need another data provider with 5 arrays (meaning populate the fields with 5 different values) to click New User, populate firstname, lastname, username,password, click register and assert the message Please Verify Recaptcha to register.
